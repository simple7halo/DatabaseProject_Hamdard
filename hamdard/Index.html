                "In 1970, we opened our 49th Avenue campus and invited the community to make us their first choice for accessible, quality education.

Four decades later, Langara College is recognized as a leading undergraduate institution with a reputation for providing exceptional learning opportunities. Through the collective contributions of our outstanding faculty and staff, our programs and services continue to grow and innovate to meet the changing needs of our community.

Looking ahead, we anticipate ongoing success as more people make Langara their college of choice. We will continue to be an educational leader, setting the standard for higher learning, and supporting our broadening communities for years to come."
